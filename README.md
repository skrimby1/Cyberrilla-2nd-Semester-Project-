# Cyberrilla â€“ Interactive Cyber Awareness Training ðŸŽ®

Cyberrilla is a full-stack interactive learning platform designed as a game to improve employeesâ€™ cybersecurity awareness. Built with Python, Pygame, Flask, Jinja2, SQLite3, REST APIs, and Matplotlib, it combines engaging mini-games with a secure backend, real-time dashboards, and compliance with GDPR, NIS2, and ISO/IEC 27001. The project implements encryption, hashing, TLS/HTTPS, SSH, and Cloudflare Tunnel for security, while following Scrum-based development, risk analysis, and structured project planning.
